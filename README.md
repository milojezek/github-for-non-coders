# GitHub for Non-coders

GitHub is a platform mainly used (and loved) by developers and people learning to code. However, even people who don't work with code can find a lot of interesting tools here. It can boost collaboration between developers and non-developers, especially if they are in the same team. But whatever you work with developers or not, GitHub is a great alternative to many collaborative apps and tools.
